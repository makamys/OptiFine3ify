# OptiFine3ify

An FML tweaker that makes OptiFine D6 compatible with Java 9 and higher.

## Why

OptiFine D6 [has been found to perform better than E7](https://gist.github.com/makamys/7cb74cd71d93a4332d2891db2624e17c#1-fastcraft-and-optifine-peculiarities) in some setups. But it [doesn't work with modern Java](https://github.com/GTNewHorizons/lwjgl3ify/issues/47). Or at least didn't until now.
